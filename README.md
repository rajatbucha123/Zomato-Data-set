# Zomato-Data-set

Overview
This project aims to analyze restaurant data from Zomato, a popular online food delivery platform, to gain insights into various aspects such as restaurant ratings, cuisines, locations, and user reviews. The dataset contains information about restaurants in different cities, their menus, average cost for two, user ratings, and more.

Objectives
Explore and visualize trends in restaurant ratings and popularity across different cities.
Analyze the distribution of cuisines and their popularity among users.
Investigate the relationship between restaurant attributes (such as cost, cuisine, location) and user ratings.
Predict restaurant ratings based on features such as cuisine, cost, and location.

Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset obtained from Zomato, which includes the following features:

1)Restaurant ID: Unique identifier for each restaurant
2)Restaurant Name: Name of the restaurant
3)Country Code: Country code for the restaurant
4)City: City where the restaurant is located
5)Address: Address of the restaurant
6)Cuisine Type: Type of cuisine offered by the restaurant
7)Average Cost for Two: Average cost for two people dining at the restaurant
8)Currency: Currency used for pricing
9)Rating: Average user rating for the restaurant
10)Votes: Number of votes received by the restaurant

Tools and Technologies
1)Programming Language: Python
2)Libraries: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
3)Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model development Visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

Methodology

1) Data Loading: Load the Zomato dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2) Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, format inconsistencies, and perform data cleaning.
3) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the dataset to understand distributions, correlations, and patterns using visualizations and statistical methods.
4) Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.
5) Model Development: Build machine learning models to predict restaurant ratings based on features such as cuisine, cost, and location.
6) Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics and techniques such as cross-validation.
7) Insights and Visualization: Communicate findings and insights through visualizations and summary reports.
